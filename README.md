## Introduction
Kepler is a open source [geosocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosocial_networking) solution that lets users share favorite places and join discussions in real-time. It can be seen as a platform where users can interact with other open data platforms searching across [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/) among other sources.
The name as the best [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) tradition wants to remain in the space field, *Kepler* is inspired by [Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_Mission) and wants to be seen as an sequel of the first and largest open source Meteor projects the old *Telescope* current *VulcanJS*.

### Mission
Allows users to collect and georeferencing places on a modern web-mapping interface, describe them accurately, create relationships, sharing with other users and create a social environment. In addition to creating new place you can import pre-existing objects from Openstreetmap creating a social layer over OpenStreetMap.
A place in Kepler can be linked to metadata from different sources automatically, it can be anything that has a geographic location fixed or movable, real or virtual.

### Expectations
In the near future Kepler as any open source projects will follow a community-driven evolution that will support it instead of the initial mission ad we hope it has growth beyond expectations.

*"Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected."*
